# FSM_ML_Assessments
Overview
Implemented Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifiers to solve a classification problem and compare their performance.

Tools
Python, NumPy, Pandas

Sklearn (performance Evaluation)

Matplotlib / Seaborn 

Method
Data preprocessing: handled missing values, encoded categorical features, selected relevant features

Trained and evaluated Naive Bayes and KNN models through custom classifiers

Compared accuracy scores

Results
Naive Bayes accuracy: ~0.79

KNN accuracy: ~0.90 (better performance)

How to Run
Install dependencies and run the scripts/notebooks.
